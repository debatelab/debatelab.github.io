In "Making Reflective Equilibrium Precise: A Formal Model," co-authored with Claus Beisbart and Georg Brun, we present a formal, computational model of reflective equilibrium (RE). The basic thrust is to *explicate* the method of RE as a process of step-wise "belief" revision that modifies -- alternately -- an agent's current commitments and her provisional theory. Such step-wise processes seek to equilibrate the conflicting desiderata of faithfulness, account and systematicity.

Do such RE-processes reach a fixed point?

We show that, in our model, this is necessarily so. Moreover, we define a full RE-state as an ideal epistemic situation (roughly: the theory fully accounts for all commitments, faithfulness plus systematicity reaches a maximum). Simulations of multiple RE processes suggest that step-wise equilibration is likely to lead to a full reflective equilibrium state. This amounts to an instrumental justification of the method of RE.

The model presented in this paper has been the starting point for our joint project ["How Far Does Reflective Equilibrium Take Us?"](https://www.philosophie.unibe.ch/research/projects/how_far_does_reflective_equilibrium_take_us/project/index_eng.html).
