[üìù [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615)] 

We have contributed the task [Formal Fallacies and Syllogisms](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/formal_fallacies_syllogisms_negation/) to the [BIG-bench ü™ë](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) project, a collaborative benchmark intended to probe large language models, and to extrapolate their future capabilities  

The following spotlight presentation at the [Workshop on Enormous Language Models](https://welmworkshop.github.io/) explains our tasks motivation and design:
