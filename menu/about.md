[DebateLab](http://debatelab.philosophie.kit.edu/) is a research group at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and associated with KIT's Department of Philosophy. It brings together scholars who

* study normative models of reasoning and argumentation;
* carry out logical analyses of policy debates and scientific controversies;
* develop methods and tools to improve the argumentative quality of public reasoning.  

This blog introduces some of DebateLab's research in computational philosophy and supplements its [GitHub repos](https://github.com/debatelab).
